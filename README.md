# HTML, CSS & JavaScript Practice Projects ðŸš€
Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey through a series of practice projects focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a special emphasis on the Document Object Model (DOM). This is not a formal course, but rather a personal collection of projects that I've built to enhance my web development skills.

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal portfolio of mini-projects that I've completed to get hands-on experience with web development technologies. It's tailored towards both reinforcing my understanding of fundamental concepts and exploring advanced functionalities. Here, you'll find a range of projects from simple UI components to more complex web applications, all aimed at practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
Through completing these projects, I've aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:

* Solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
* Gain practical experience with the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it.
* Explore various web development techniques and best practices.
* Build a diverse portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills and creativity in web development.
